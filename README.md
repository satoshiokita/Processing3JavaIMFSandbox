>The problem is that this method, while cloning your project correctly, insists on adding a sub directory under what should be the repository root.... so let's say our repositories are stored by default at /Users/beldougie/git/MyProject. What you'd get is the project being created at /Users/cinh/git/MyProject/MyProject which isn't what we're after. Especially if you're working on something to be distributed. You need it to be >structured correctly.
